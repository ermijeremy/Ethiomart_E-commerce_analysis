## 📦 Project Overview

EthioMart is building Ethiopia’s first AI-powered e-commerce intelligence platform by aggregating Telegram vendor data. This project develops a **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** pipeline to extract key business entities (Product, Price, Location) from Amharic text and uses these insights to **score micro-vendors** for potential fintech services (e.g., lending, partnerships).

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Extract structured product data from unstructured Amharic Telegram posts.
- Fine-tune a multilingual NER model using CoNLL-labeled Amharic data.
- Interpret model predictions to ensure fairness and explainability.
- Design a vendor **activity and reach scorecard** based on extracted data.
